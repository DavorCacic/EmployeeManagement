@* This sets default layout page for all other pages. ViewStart file is hierarchical, meaning that if placed in folder "Home"
   that one will override one in "View" folder. This is convinient to set different layouts for different folders/sets of pages.
   Also, layout could be specified in page directly, and this will override layout defined for specific folder.
   So, hierarchy goes:
        1. _ViewStart in View folder, 
        2. _ViewStart in specific folder (like "Home"),
        3. Layout define in page itself (here it could be set tu null, and then layout will not be used at all).
   Code in ViewStart is executed before idvidiual code on page. Also, it could be defined dynamic logic for chosing dfferent 
   layouts (if user is admin, use this layout, etc.).
